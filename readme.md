**Overview**
------------

The Chat PDF Application is a web-based chatbot application that allows users to upload PDF files and engage in a conversation with a GPT-2 model. The application is built using Flask, a popular Python web framework, and utilizes the LLaMA GPT-2 model for natural language processing.

**Features**
------------

*   **PDF Upload**: Users can upload PDF files to the application, which are then processed and converted to text.
*   **Chat Interface**: The application provides a chat interface where users can interact with the GPT-2 model, asking questions and receiving responses.
*   **GPT-2 Integration**: The application utilizes the LLaMA GPT-2 model to generate responses to user input.
*   **Flask Framework**: The application is built using the Flask web framework, making it easy to deploy and maintain.
